Very early stages of learning data analytics :-)

I'm a Construction Project Manager currently, but always had an interest in computer science and data analytics. I've found myself most engaged in my current job when analyzing data to identify productivity trends and opportunities, but have generally been doing it in a pretty rudimentary manner (I think) in Excel. I'm here to learn and improve, and maybe pivot professionally once I gain enough proficiency.
